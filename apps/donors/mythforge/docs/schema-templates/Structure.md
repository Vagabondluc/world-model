# Structure

## Container Model

- UUID container: the persistent entity instance that the UI projects.
- Schema binding: explicit and versioned; see `UUID_CONTAINER_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Event behavior: append-only history is attached to the UUID.
- Projection: the current UI state is derived from the active binding plus the event log.
- Migration: schema changes require an explicit versioned migration.
- Runtime mapping: native schemas are code-backed; project schemas are file-backed.

Recommended fields:
- `name`: string
- `structureType`: string
